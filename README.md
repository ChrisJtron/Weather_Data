Using the OpenWeatherMap API, weather data was imported to a Jupyter Notebook.

Using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib different aspects of weather were analyzed for over 500 cities around the world.
Each variable is considered in respect to it's latitude, looking for correlations between lattitude and weather for that particular day.
